# 🔍 LLM-Integrated-Automated-EDA-Tool

This project is an **AI-powered EDA tool** that lets you upload a CSV file and instantly generate insights, summary statistics, and visualizations using large language models. Built using **Python**, **Gradio**, and **Pandas**, this app enables quick, one-click exploratory data analysis with natural language explanations.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Upload any `.csv` file
- ✅ Automatic data profiling and summary generation
- ✅ Visual insights: histograms, KDE plots, count plots, and correlation heatmap
- ✅ Natural language explanations powered by LLMs
- ✅ Beautiful and responsive UI with **Gradio**

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Upload a CSV file through the Gradio interface.
2. The app analyzes data types, missing values, and statistical distributions.
3. It uses a local or API-based language model (e.g., `OpenAI` or `Ollama`) to explain patterns in plain English.
4. Plots and insights are generated dynamically.
